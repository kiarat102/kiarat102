## Hi there 👋

<!--
**kiarat102/kiarat102** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


1.	Kiara Torres / kntorres@my.waketech.edu
2.	My GitHub account is a platform on the internet that host source control repositories, which enables developers to work on the same code base together. It tracks my work and records changes to files so it can easily be recalled later.
3.	My repository that I created is a public core location that stores data and files.
4.	I downloaded GitHub Desktop and clicked the "+" icon in the top left corner of the screen and selected "Clone a repository” I chose the repository that I created on the website and that enabled it to download a copy of my repository onto my file explorer folder.
